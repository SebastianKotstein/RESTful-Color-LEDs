# RESTful Color LEDs
A Web of Things approach which allows us to control RGB LEDs (e.g. WS8212b) over a RESTful API. This repository contains the sources for the RESTful API written in C# .NET as well as the .ino firmware file for an ESP8266 which drives the RGB LEDs.

Note that this project is still under development. The provided content (sources & documentation) might be inconsistent and incomplete.
